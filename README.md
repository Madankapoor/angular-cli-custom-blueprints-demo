This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.16.

This project demonstrates the possibility to generate a custom blueprint with angular-cli.

Your custom blueprints should be in subdirectories of the blueprints/ directory of your project.

    -- app

You can find templates for your custom blueprints in the angular-cli project, directory packages/angular-cli/blueprints.
